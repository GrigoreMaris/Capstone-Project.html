<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Grigore Maris and i'm currently transitioning into the world of software.For the past six year, i've worked in the construction industry,
  primarily at Hinkley point C, a nuclear power station under construction. I started as a niphand, assisting other steelfixers, before becoming a steelfixer myself,
  where i've worked for four years or so.
</p>

<p>Now, i'm following mky passion for technology and learning how to code trough a really good course i found on Udemy.
  The transition from construction to coding may seem like a leap, but both fileds require problem solving skills, attention to detail, 
  and perseverance- qualities i've developed and now bring in to my programming jouirney.
